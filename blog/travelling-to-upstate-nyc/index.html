Anywhere along the Hudson River is easy, I&rsquo;ve done 3 or 4 routes. Good views, nice
trees and greenery. Plenty of lists on AllHikes like <a href=https://www.alltrails.com/lists/upstate-new-york>Upstate NYC Hikes</a> or
<a href=https://jessieonajourney.com/best-hikes-in-upstate-new-york/>Best Hikes</a></li><li>Drinking. So many <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/brewery/@41.8269701,-74.159889,9.5z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e5?entry=ttu">breweries</a>

Zooming in on those maps and re-searching will yield more</li><li><a href=https://stormking.org/>Storm King Art Center</a> - giant sculpture park with bike rentals. Cute, great place for fun pics. Maybe half a day there</li><li>If you like just driving around and seeing views, there are tons of small back roads through cities and forrests that are great. Some areas:<ul><li><a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/n8rJ21T3thyCCW3s9>Ashokan Reservoir</a> - can start here and drive around the lake</li><li><a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/PShioxZsB6EmtNxu9>Big Indian Wilderness</a> - Just find roads and drive, no plan</li><li><a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/UmMx6iUebobHqmAa8>Calicoon</a> - i think this is a quaint little city over near Livingston Manor that might be very Amish.
if you&rsquo;re nearby, worth a drive through. Otherwise not</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=locations>Locations</h2><ul><li><p>Albany is a 3 hr drive north, and you probably don&rsquo;t need to go any further or you&rsquo;re gonna be driving a lot. I&rsquo;d recommend staying in this circle:</p><p><img src="https://github.com/KashMoneyMillionaire/kash.money/blob/main/content/blog/Upstate-NYC-Boundary.png?raw=true" alt=image></p></li><li><p>Furthest west I&rsquo;ve stayed is Hancock. It gets kinda boonies and small town out there, but Livingston Manor is nice and you can swim in the river (seasons may be cold)</p></li><li><p>Rhinebeck is a cute, wealthy town close to plenty of activities, food, drinks, activities</p></li><li><p>Beacon is a cute town with lots of visitors for hiking, with streets of stores and food and pizza and drinks and whatnot.</p></li><li><p>West Point, the military school. I think you can drive around the campus and grounds?</p></li><li><p>Other places: Reed Hook, Pughkeepsie, Catskill, Hudson, New Paltz</p></li></ul></div></section><footer><p>&copy; 2021 | <a href=/attributions>Attributions</a></p></footer></main></body></html>
