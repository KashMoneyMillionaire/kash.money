In roughly the order I'd recommend to others:

1. The Morning Brew - Chris Alcock (cwa.me.uk) - this also has great daily news about all things dotnet/c#/azure/some msft/some db/ some react. I read this daily
2. dotnetrocks - a fantastic podcast where they interview all these big names in dotnet, and the creators of these libraries. this is where i got started and learned a ton
  - Jimmy Bogard - .NET Rocks! Mediatr with Jimmy Bogard (dotnetrocks.com)
  - Jeremy Miller - .NET Rocks! Minimal Architecture with Jeremy Miller (dotnetrocks.com)
  - Mads Torgersen - .NET Rocks! The Next C# with Mads Torgersen (dotnetrocks.com)
  - Steven Smith - .NET Rocks! Clean Architecture in 2023 with Steven Smith (dotnetrocks.com)
3. /r/programming some
4. /r/csharp and /r/dotnet some
5. Some dotnet conferences and videos - NDC Conferences, dotnet, GOTO Conferences, Strange Loop Conference (really anything from that link i posted the other day: https://techtalksweekly.substack.com/p/top-tech-talks-of-2023)
6. Things like quozd/awesome-dotnet and mjebrahimi/Awesome-Nuget-Packages which i check when i'm looking to solve a problem (and i just found these by googling "dotnet awesome nuget". github is filled with "awesome-XXX" repos keeping track of things)
