## Activities
- Lots of hiking of all kinds of skill levels. Anywhere along the Hudson River is easy, I've done 3 or 4 routes. Good views, nice
  trees and greenery. Plenty of lists on AllHikes like [Upstate NYC Hikes](https://www.alltrails.com/lists/upstate-new-york) or
  [Best Hikes](https://jessieonajourney.com/best-hikes-in-upstate-new-york/)
- Drinking. So many [breweries](https://www.google.com/maps/search/brewery/@41.8269701,-74.159889,9.5z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e5?entry=ttu) 
  and [distilleries](https://www.google.com/maps/search/distillery/@41.7755667,-74.1889097,9z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu)
  and [wineries](https://www.google.com/maps/search/winery/@41.7678438,-74.3639274,9.75z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e5?entry=ttu) up state.
  Zooming in on those maps and re-searching will yield more
- [Storm King Art Center](https://stormking.org/) - giant sculpture park with bike rentals. Cute, great place for fun pics. Maybe half a day there
- If you like just driving around and seeing views, there are tons of small back roads through cities and forrests that are great. Some areas:
  - [Ashokan Reservoir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n8rJ21T3thyCCW3s9) - can start here and drive around the lake
  - [Big Indian Wilderness](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PShioxZsB6EmtNxu9) - Just find roads and drive, no plan
  - [Calicoon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UmMx6iUebobHqmAa8) - i think this is a quaint little city over near Livingston Manor that might be very Amish.
    if you're nearby, worth a drive through. Otherwise not

## Locations
- Albany is a 3 hr drive north, and you probably don't need to go any further or you're gonna be driving a lot. I'd recommend staying in this circle:

- Furthest west I've stayed is Hancock. It gets kinda boonies and small town out there, but Livingston Manor is nice and you can swim in the river (seasons may be cold)
- Rhinebeck is a cute, wealthy town close to plenty of activities, food, drinks, activities
- Beacon is a cute town with lots of visitors for hiking, with streets of stores and food and pizza and drinks and whatnot.
- West Point, the military school. I think you can drive around the campus and grounds?
- Other places: Reed Hook, Pughkeepsie, Catskill, Hudson, New Paltz
