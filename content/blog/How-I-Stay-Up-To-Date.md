> My thoughts on how I keep up with things happening in the technology world. This is mostly tilted towards .NET, Azure, MSFT since
that is my day to day


## Ranked List

In roughly the order I'd recommend to others (see details below):
1. **Daily** - Dew Drop and The Morning Brew
2. **Daily** (though only 1-3 good articles a day) - /r/programming
3. **Weekly** dotnetrocks
5. **Semi-Weekly** - Watching youtube videos of conferences and updates
